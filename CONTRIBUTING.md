# Contributing to the FLiNT Website

Thank you for considering contributing to this repo! This project is maintained by FLiNT's Marketing Committee and will be passed down yearly to new teams. To ensure smooth collaboration, please follow these guidelines when contributing.

## Getting Started

### 1. Fork and Clone the Repository

Before making changes, fork the repository and clone your fork:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/your-project.git
cd your-project
```

### 2. Set Up Your Environment

- Review the README.md for installation and setup instructions.
- Ensure you have the required dependencies installed (Docker, Node.js, Python, etc.).
- Run the project locally to verify functionality before making changes.

### 3. Branching Strategy

All development should take place on feature branches, not directly on main. Use the following branch naming conventions:
- Feature development: feature-name (e.g., feature-interview-scheduler)
- Bug fixes: bugfix-name (e.g., bugfix-login-error)
- Hotfixes: hotfix-name (e.g., hotfix-critical-issue)

Create a new branch before making changes:

```bash
git checkout -b feature-your-feature
```

## Contributing Code

### 4. Making Changes & Commit Messages

- Make small, focused changes to keep pull requests manageable.
- Write clear commit messages:
```bash
git commit -m "Added new scheduling logic"
```

### 5. Pull Requests & Code Review

- Submit a pull request (PR) to merge changes into main.
- PRs should include:
  - A clear description of the changes.
  - Any relevant issue numbers.
  - Tests and documentation updates if applicable.
Team members will review your PR before approval. If changes are requested, address them before merging.

## Issue Tracking & Project Management

### 6. Reporting Issues

If you find a bug or want to suggest an enhancement:
- Check existing issues before creating a new one.
- Use GitHub Issues with clear descriptions and labels.

### 7. Using GitHub Projects

We use GitHub Projects for tracking development progress. Tasks are categorized as:
- To Do → Unstarted tasks.
- In Progress → Active development.
- Review → Awaiting feedback/testing.
- Done → Completed tasks.

## Documentation Guidelines

Since this project will be passed down yearly, keeping documentation up-to-date is crucial.

### 8. Updating Documentation
- If you change project structure or functionality, update README.md.
- Add relevant details in the docs/ directory.
- Maintain CHANGELOG.md for version updates.
